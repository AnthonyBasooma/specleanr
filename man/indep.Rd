\title{threshold independent evaluation}
\usage{
indep(probs, observed, P, A)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{Model probabilities after predictions.}

\item{observed}{The observed probabilities.}

\item{P}{Character for presence label. Important to indicate the presence/absence character to correctly compute the evaluation metric in \code{evaluate} function.}

\item{A}{Character for absence label. Important to indicate the presence/absence character to correctly compute the evaluation metric in \code{evaluate} function.}
}
\value{
Area Under the Curve values
}
\description{
threshold independent evaluation
}
\details{
The threshold-independent evalation parameter does not dependent on the cutoff to classify probability if a species is present or not.
In this package we incorporated the Area Under Receiver Operating Curve based on \strong{Hanley & McNeil Barbra (1982)}.
