\title{Identifies absolute outliers for multiple species.}
\usage{
multiabsolute(
  x,
  threshold = NULL,
  props = FALSE,
  warn = FALSE,
  autothreshold = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{datacleaner} class for each methods used to identify outliers
in \code{multidetect} function.}

\item{threshold}{\code{numeric}. Maximum value to denote an absolute outlier.
The threshold ranges from \code{0}, which indicates a point has not been
flagged by any outlier detection method as an \code{outlier}, to \code{1},
which means the record is an absolute or true outlier since all methods
have identified it. At both extremes, many records are classified at low
threshold values, which may be due to individual method weakness or
strength and data distribution. Also, at higher threshold values, the true
outliers are retained. For example, if ten methods are considered and 9
methods flag a record as an outlier, If a cutoff of 1 is used, then that
particular record is retained. Therefore, the \code{default} cutoff is
\code{0.6}, but \code{autothreshold} can be used to select the appropriate
threshold.}

\item{props}{\code{dataframe}. To output the proportional absoluteness for
each outlier.}

\item{warn}{\code{logical}. If \strong{TRUE}, warning on whether absolute
outliers obtained at a low threshold is indicated. Default \strong{TRUE}.}

\item{autothreshold}{\code{vector}. Identifies the threshold with mean number
of absolute outliers.The search is limited within 0.51 to 1 since
thresholds less than are deemed inappropriate for identifying absolute
outliers. The autothreshold is used when \code{threshold} is set to
\code{NULL}.}
